## Backstory
Orbab was born in Kamago to the Hellrider Tribe, a group of fanatical raiders who worship their leader, Maximus Hellrider. Orbab worshipped Hellrider and saw him as the messiah for much of his childhood, until he witnessed a Golden Knight of Law slaughtering the monsters of Brosyk's wastes on a patrol. He was immediately enamoured with the Knight, seeing him as an angel, and wanting to be just like him. Orbab spend many years secretly finding whatever he could on the corpses of Vigilants, trying to learn more about Helm and the shiney golden Knights. Eventually, he decided to devote himself to Helm, leaving the Hellriders in the dead and sneaking across the borders of Alrika and Dixukae to reach the portal to the Shadowfell. 
He escaped Brosyk into the Shadowfell, spending a few months in the plane, barely managing to make it out with his life when he landed in [[Kalgar]].

- Arrived on [[Kalgar]] in a portal about 1 days travel from [[Sword Bridge Refugee Camp]] after following groups of refugees he ended up there. He has been there for around 5 days at this point.
