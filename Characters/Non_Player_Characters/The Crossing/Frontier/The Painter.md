### The Wave Crashing
**THE *Potential* EVENT** - The sacking of Tickhammer by the Vermintide
A wave of black water flowing over the land and crashing into a walled city. The city is firing rockets and cannons into the wave. If you look closely at the foam the black water appears to be lots of small creatures. 
### Smile it will be ok
**THE *Potential* EVENT** - The death of Johnny
A beautiful pebble and rock beach. There are a few out of focus trinkets sprinkled around. In the centre is a smooth mask with a cracked smile on it.
### Scratching an Itch
**THE *Potential* EVENT** - The Creation of the [[Scar of the Rage God]]
The shoulder of a giant. Its shoulder has quite a harsh light cast on it you can see the outline of [[Kalgar]] in the light/shadow. A long claw is being dragged along the shoulder in the same location as the [[Scar of the Rage God]].
