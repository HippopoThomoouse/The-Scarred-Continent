# Story
## Before the Clowns Maze
- Bumbling idiot cleric who got his head smashed in by centaurs
## The Clowns Maze
- Was captured by one of the clowns while there he absorbed the clowns mask. This fixed his physical deformities and made him more intelligent.
- It also made him insane:
	- Brian thinks he is: “I am the smartest, wisest, strongest, fastest, and most beautiful person I know.”
## Life after ‘Enlightenment’ 
- Thinks he is the chosen vessel of a new god. As a result Brian created the [[Cult of New God]].
- Due to his miraculous recovery he has quickly gained a following among the refugees at [[Sword Bridge Refugee Camp]] as well as a few local guards.
