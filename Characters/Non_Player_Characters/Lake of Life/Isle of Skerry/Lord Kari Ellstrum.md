## The Former Crown of Tyranny

### Before The ‘ONE-SHOT’

#### Before [[Cyric]]
Traveling Entertainer who somehow met and got with [[Cyric]] and became the crown of Tyranny. **TBD….**
#### After [[Cyric]]
He set up a small home on the Isle of Skerry on The Lake of Life in [[Kalgar]]. From here he infiltrated neighbouring countries as a bard/foreign dignitary or whatever else suited his fancy. Once in place in their court he quickly dug up dirt on every important player in the region. Using this as well as a large amount of magic he then inserted himself into important positions within the realm making a large fortune in the process.

After this he forcefully evicted every inhabitant of the [[Isle of Skerry]]. Any locals who resisted were brutally murdered. With the money he made he built an enormous castle on the island. From then on his ambition grew using an intricate teleportation system ([[Kari’s Teleportation Network]]) built into the castle. This allowed him access to the entirety of [[Kalgar]] and much of [[Cathri]] and beyond.

After learning the magic behind creating simulacrums. Kari spent and enormous amount of money and effort to create enough so that he could have the ability to be in almost every court on both continents at the same time. Once in place he exerted an enormous amount of influence on the entire world. This influence was mostly unseen and performed to further both his own personal end as well as those of [[Cyric]]’s.
### After The ‘ONE-SHOT’
The [[Isle of Skerry]] is almost impossible to travel too. Strong magic causes any traveller to take the relatively short journey (60 miles across the lake), to get lost. His teleportation network will be lost to the world and fall into disrepair. Any who attempt to use it without the proper knowledge could face some very nasty consequences
#### If he doesn’t die
Something happens to do with him trying to gain too much power. [[Cyric]] punishes him cursing and trapping him on the [[Isle of Skerry]].
#### If he does die
Other weird different shit happens to the [[Isle of Skerry]]
