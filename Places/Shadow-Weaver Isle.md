## Fairy Tales
## The Isle
The [[Shadow-Weaver Isle]] is a mystical place that appears somewhere in the sea/oceans around [[Kalgar]]. It appears seemingly at random and then as soon as you leave it disappears. No-one has ever travelled there twice. At least no one has ever travelled there twice and lived to tell the tale.

On its shores are rocky and pebble beaches. The stones warn smooth by millennia of weathering. On the beach there are hundreds of different items that have washed up over the years. Some are simple trinkets and keepsakes. Others are legendary artefacts and weapons. All of which have been preserved perfectly. However each and every item contains an extremely dangerous curse.
### The Curse of the Shadow Isle
For any who take an object from the beach of the isle each time they fall asleep until this item is returned they will lose one memory from their past. This effect starts slow however after a year and a day their mind will become blank and they will be left an empty shell. 

The only way to break the curse is to return the item to the beach by finding the island again (the item will help show the way). Or to cast greater restoration using the wish spell.

## The Tapestry of Shadow
A tapestry that contains the entire past history of the the world of Auxilan. At one end sits [[The Shadow Weaver]]. They pull together strings adding them to the tapestry.

The tapestry can only be read in full by the weaver and the gods. However mortals can read parts although if they do not have the permission of the weaver then they will likely go mad rather than gain true insight.
